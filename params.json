(Maybe)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n* You can download the app from the website with Basic auth.\r\n* You can add entries with URL. (Using Android's intent)\r\n* Apps will be automatically updated if there are any updates after booting device.\r\n\r\n### And in the future...\r\n\r\n* Administrator can restrict add/modify/delete entries with password.\r\n* Administrator can manage application lifetime, which means\r\n  that you can control when the users can download and use the app.\r\n\r\n## How to add entries using Intent\r\n\r\nIf you want to an entry on multiple devices, you can send email with a special format URL.\r\n\r\n### import-to-manager host\r\n\r\nAppManager supports `http` and `https` scheme with `app-manager.github.io` or `import-to-manager` host.\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\n\r\nIf you send an email with following URL,\r\n\r\n> https://**user**:**pass**@**app-manager.github.io**/github.com/app-manager/AppManager-for-Android/blob/master/tests/apk/dummy.apk?raw=true#**appName**\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n> https://**user**:**pass**@**import-to-appmanager**/github.com/app-manager/AppManager-for-Android/blob/master/tests/apk/dummy.apk?raw=true#**appName**\r\n\r\nâ†“\r\n\r\nAppManager will parse URL and set information for a new entry:\r\n\r\n```\r\nName: appName\r\nBasic Auth User: user\r\nBasic Auth Password: pass\r\nURL: https://github.com/app-manager/AppManager-for-Android/blob/master/tests/apk/dummy.apk?raw=true\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that `import-to-appmanager` is simple but not a valid domain format, so some mailers won't assume it as an URL.  \r\nIf you have any troubles with using `import-to-appmanager` as a host name, please use `app-manager.github.io` instead.\r\n\r\n## Automatic update\r\n\r\nAppManager checks if there are any updates when the device has been booted, by sending HTTP request to each URLs and checking Etags.\r\n\r\n## Developed By\r\n\r\n* Soichiro Kashima - <soichiro.kashima@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n    Copyright 2014 Soichiro Kashima\r\n\r\n    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\n    you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\n    You may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n        http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\n    Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\n    distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\n    See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\n    limitations under the License.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
