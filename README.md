AppManager for Android
===

AppManager is the application to download and install the apps
from outside the Google Play Store.


## Why do you need this app?

* For alpha / beta application testing,
  you can distribute app from your web servers, but
  the Web browsers of Android is basically not be able to download
  the apk files from the site with BASIC / DIGEST auth,
  which makes it difficult to distribute apps to limited users.
* You can now use Google Play's alpha / beta distribution feature,
  but it is limited to only 2 versions (alpha and beta).
  We often need more variations of an app in some situations.
  For example, the app uses a Web service and it contains an API key
  for each clients.
* And this app will solve these problems! (Maybe)


## Features

Warning: This app is under development and unavailable for now
so these features are not implemented.

* You can download the app from the website with Basic/Digest auth.
* Administrator can manage application lifetime, which means
  that you can control when the users can download and use the app.
